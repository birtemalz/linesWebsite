title: What's Happened in a Stormy Night?

This is a generative writing with visual and audio contents, 
processed by using p5.js. It is a try on horror fiction, by 
generating endless sentences which may not be related to the 
others. In horror fictions, to create discomforting atmosphere, 
writers spend lots of words describing the horror scenes, including 
the environment and the reaction of characters. When these words were 
used for creating a new sentence, will that sentence have a similar 
atmosphere? In other words, will a phrase or word carry certain kind 
of mood? Visual and audio elements also cooperate deeply with the 
sentences. To what extent will these further emphasize the atmosphere? 
These are some questions I am exploring in this work.

Markov chain was used as the main algorithm to generate natural language. 
For the data inserted, they are paragraphs from several horror fictions, 
which are describing either murder, beasts, monsters, corpse, thunderstorm 
or heavy rain. Each of the horror topics will have corresponding images, 
which will appear in a moment when there is lightning.
