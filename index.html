      <h5>  Any story told contains – and conceals – a plentitude of others that are not.  
      <br> Sometimes we might walk through life starting to expect everyone around us to see the same 
        – to tell the same story as we would. Lost in our own perspective... 
        This is just a little narrative wake-up call questioning the power of who tells the story – and how. 
        What would happen if we try to tell them from all sides? </h5>
